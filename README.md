# Neural Network
Basic neural network logic to guess handwritten digits (Mnist dataset)

# Train
Run `python3 train.py`
This will automatically start training on Mnist test data, default is 100 iterations but can be cancelled with a Keyboard interrupt and will still save the code

# Test
Run `python3 test.py`
This will plot an image of a random handwritten digit as well as the neural networks guess (result) and the true answer (expected)
